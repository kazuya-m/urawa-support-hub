## Removed Issues (Personal use - not needed)

- ~~#34 Security and permission detailed design~~ - Over-engineering
- ~~#32 Database migration management~~ - Initial schema only
- ~~#18 End-to-end test suite~~ - Manual testing sufficient
- ~~#31 Notification service integration~~ - Included in each service
- ~~#16 System health monitoring Edge Function~~ - Discord alerts sufficient
- ~~#15 Notification Edge Function~~ - Direct notification from Cloud Run

## Development Progress Rules

### 1. Keep It Simple

- Minimal implementation for personal use
- No staging environment
- Direct deployment to production
- Manual testing acceptable

### 2. Branch Strategy

- **Pattern**: `feature/#<issue-number>_<description>`
- **Example**: `feature/#36_basic-types`

### 3. Completion Criteria

Each issue is considered complete when:

- [ ] Feature works
- [ ] `deno check` passes
- [ ] Manual test passes

## Milestones

### MVP Launch (10 days from start)

- **Target**: All issues in Phase 1-4
- **Success Criteria**: Basic ticket monitoring and LINE notification working
