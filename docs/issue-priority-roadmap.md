## Minimum Launch Conditions

Upon completion of Phase 1-4, the following will be achieved:

- âœ… Daily ticket information retrieval
- âœ… LINE and Discord notification delivery
- âœ… Basic error monitoring

### Phase 5: Operational Improvements (Post-launch implementation)

**Deadline**: Implement gradually during operation\
**Purpose**: Improve operational efficiency and code quality

| Issue | Title                                              | Priority  | Reason                                |

| #34   | Security and permission management detailed design | ðŸŸ¡ Medium | Security enhancement                  |

## Development Progress Rules

### 1. Phase Adherence

- **Required**: Proceed to next phase only after previous phase completion
- **Reason**: Development efficiency and risk management through dependency management

### 2. Branch Strategy

- **Pattern**: `feature/#<issue-number>_<description>`
- **Example**: `feature/#28_gcp-project-setup`

### 3. Completion Criteria

Each issue is considered complete when the following conditions are met:

- [ ] Feature implementation complete
- [ ] `deno check` success
- [ ] `deno lint` success
- [ ] Unit tests created and passing
- [ ] Integration tests executed and passing

### 4. Emergency Response

If Phase 1-4 requires more effort than expected:

- **Priority**: Prioritize launch even with feature reduction
- **Deferrable**: Move Discord notifications (#30) to Phase 5
- **Deferrable**: Simplify system monitoring features (#16)

## Milestones

### MVP Launch (2025-09-30)

- **Target**: All issues in Phase 1-4
- **Success Criteria**: Basic ticket monitoring and notification functionality operational

### Post-Launch Improvements (No deadline)

- **Target**: All issues in Phase 5
- **Success Criteria**: Gradual improvement of operational efficiency and quality
