### Phase 3: Notification Services (2 days)

**Purpose**: Implement notification delivery

| Issue | Title                                                       | Priority    | Reason                     |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| #27   | LINE notification service implementation                    | ðŸ”´ Critical | Main notification channel  |

| -     | Manual testing            | ðŸ”´ Critical | Final verification          |

## Removed Issues (Personal use - not needed)

- ~~#34 Security and permission detailed design~~ - Over-engineering
- ~~#32 Database migration management~~ - Initial schema only
- ~~#18 End-to-end test suite~~ - Manual testing sufficient
- ~~#31 Notification service integration~~ - Included in each service
- ~~#16 System health monitoring Edge Function~~ - Discord alerts sufficient
- ~~#15 Notification Edge Function~~ - Direct notification from Cloud Run

## Development Progress Rules

### 1. Keep It Simple
- Minimal implementation for personal use
- No staging environment
- Direct deployment to production
- Manual testing acceptable

### 2. Branch Strategy
- **Pattern**: `feature/#<issue-number>_<description>`
- **Example**: `feature/#36_basic-types`

### 3. Completion Criteria
Each issue is considered complete when:
- [ ] Feature works
- [ ] `deno check` passes
- [ ] Manual test passes

## Milestones

### MVP Launch (10 days from start)
- **Target**: All issues in Phase 1-4
- **Success Criteria**: Basic ticket monitoring and LINE notification working
